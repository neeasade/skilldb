## skilldb
This is an employee skills database project using angular-meteor, and ng-table. The focus is on angular usage, meteor primarily used for deployment and easy database sync so you don't have to think about it.

There are two types of users, users who can edit data, and users who can't, you must have a logon to view the data.

## how do I run this?
- Install meteor: https://www.meteor.com/install
